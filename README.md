My settings for [Sublime Text 2][].


For a clean install of Sublime Text 2, first [install Package Control][], then clone these to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User` and restart Sublime Text 2. 

Haven't tried installing on Linux or Windows yet but this makes getting going on a clean Mac much easier.
