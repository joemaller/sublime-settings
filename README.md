My settings for [Sublime Text 3][].

For a clean install of Sublime Text 3, first [install Package Control][], then clone these to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User` (mac) or `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User` (linux) and restart Sublime Text 3. Or maybe clone first and install Package Control second. Both work, neither are as simple or error-free as I'd like.

My current favorite monospace coding font is Adobe's open source [Source Code Pro][].
